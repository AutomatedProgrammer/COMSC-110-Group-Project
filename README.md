# COMSC-110-Group-Project
A quadratic calculator made for DVC's Introduction to Programming class.
Uses a textfile as input and output. Equations are fed into the program with the input file and solutions are printed in the output file. Also features a graph of the equations. The way we're putting this together is having each member upload a portion of the program and one person will put it all together into one main program.

Finished.

ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ( x1 , x2 )

a, b, and c are coefficients.

x1 and x2 are the beginning and end of the domain.

The domain serves to tell the program where to start and end the graph.

Domain is in interval notation for ease of programming.
