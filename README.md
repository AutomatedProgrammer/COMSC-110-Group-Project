# COMSC-110-Group-Project
A quadratic calculator made for DVC's Introduction to Programming class.
Uses a textfile as input and output. Equations are fed into the program with the input file and solutions are printed in the output file. Also features a graph of the equations. The way we're putting this together is having each member upload a portion of the program and one person will put it all together into one main program.
(Project is finished and currently building for a release build)
